## 📁 Data Organization

Data is organized hierarchically:
- **Year** → **Government** → **President** → **Ministry** → **Department** → **Data Files**

### Data File Structure
Each dataset contains:
- `data.json` - The main dataset
- `metadata.json` - Metadata about the dataset (optional)

## 🔄 How to Update Data and Regenerate HTML

### 1. Adding New Data

#### Adding Data for a New Year
1. Create a new folder under `data/` (e.g., `data/2024/`)
2. Follow the existing folder structure:
   ```
   data/2024/
   └── Government of Sri Lanka(government)/
       └── [President Name](citizen)/
           └── [Ministry Name](minister)/
               └── [Department Name](department)/
                   ├── [category]/
                   │   ├── data.json
                   │   └── metadata.json (optional)
   ```

#### Adding Data to Existing Year
1. Navigate to the appropriate year folder in `data/`
2. Follow the existing hierarchy to find the correct ministry/department
3. Add your `data.json` and optional `metadata.json` files

#### Data File Requirements
- **data.json**: Must contain valid JSON data
- **metadata.json**: Optional, should contain dataset metadata (description, source, etc.)
- Files must be placed in appropriately named folders with category indicators

### 2. Update the Website (Optional)

The API documentation website is built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages. The data listing is auto-generated and injected into `docs/index.md`.

To update the data listing:

1.  Run the update script:
    ```bash
    python3 update_dataset_index.py
    ```
2.  This will:
    *   Scan the `data/` directory.
    *   Generate ZIP files for each year.
    *   Inject the file listing into `docs/index.md`.
3.  Commit and push changes to `main` branch.

### 3. What Gets Generated

#### ZIP Files
- Automatically created for each year folder
- Contains all JSON files from that year
- Named as `[YEAR]_Data.zip` (e.g., `2019_Data.zip`)

#### HTML Features
- Interactive collapsible sections
- Download buttons for yearly ZIP files
- In-browser JSON viewer with copy/download functionality
- Responsive design with CSS styling

### 4. Folder Structure Guidelines

#### Special Naming Conventions
- Use `(government)`, `(citizen)`, `(minister)`, `(department)` suffixes for proper categorization
- Use `(AS_CATEGORY)` for sub-categories
- Underscores in folder names will be converted to spaces in display

### 5. Customization

#### Adding New Emojis
Edit the `get_emoji_for_type()` function in `generate_static_html.py`:
```python
emoji_map = {
    'your_category': '🎯',
    # ... existing mappings
}
```

#### Modifying CSS
Edit `styles.css` to customize the appearance:
- Colors, fonts, spacing
- Responsive breakpoints
- Modal styling for JSON viewer

#### Updating Statistics
The script automatically counts datasets, but you can manually update the description in the `main()` function.
