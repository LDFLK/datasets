# Contribute Government Data

Our mission is to open up Sri Lankan government information that informs labour, social welfare, and economic planning. We prioritise official, machine-readable releases from ministries, departments, bureaus, and commissions.

## Core Document Types
- **Gazettes and Extraordinary Gazettes** announcing labour, migration, or social protection measures.
- **Acts of Parliament** and amendments governing employment, foreign recruitment, and worker protection.
- **Regulations and Rules** issued under enabling legislation, especially those defining manpower categories, licensing, and compliance.
- **Circulars and Directives** from ministries, departments, or provincial authorities that change procedures or service delivery.
- **Budget Speeches and Estimates** detailing allocations to labour, vocational training, or foreign employment programmes.
- **Cabinet Decisions** and press summaries related to overseas worker welfare or labour market interventions.
- **Annual Reports** from agencies such as the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau, Department of Labour, Central Bank, and tourism authorities.
- **Statistical Compendiums** (e.g., Labour Force Survey, migration bulletins) published by government statistical units.
- **Survey Microdata** released through official data portals or upon request, with licence terms permitting open sharing.
- **Administrative Registers** like approved recruitment agencies, accredited training centres, or welfare beneficiaries.

## Format Expectations
- Prefer structured formats (`CSV`, `JSON`, `XLSX`) with UTF-8 text.
- Include accompanying metadata: issuing authority, publication date, coverage period, and any confidentiality notes.
- Provide original URLs or document identifiers (gazette number, act number) for traceability.

## Why This Matters
Making these materials easy to find and analyse supports researchers, journalists, and communities tracking how public funds and policies affect Sri Lankan workers at home and abroad.
